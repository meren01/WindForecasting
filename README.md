# Wind Power Forecasting (ML & Data Science) 🌬️

This project focuses on predicting wind energy output using **Machine Learning** and time-series analysis. It demonstrates the application of advanced predictive modeling to solve energy stability challenges, specifically tailored for regions like **Adana**.

## 🚀 Overview
Accurate wind power forecasting is essential for modern grid management. This project analyzes historical wind data and environmental factors to provide reliable energy production estimates.

## 🧠 Machine Learning Models
To ensure the highest accuracy, I implemented and compared several industry-standard algorithms:
* **Random Forest (RF):** Used for robust ensemble learning and handling non-linear data relationships.
* **Decision Trees (DT):** Utilized for clear data branching and interpretability of wind patterns.
* **Artificial Neural Networks (ANN):** Implemented to capture complex, high-dimensional patterns in time-series data.
